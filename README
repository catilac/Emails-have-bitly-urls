EmailsHaveBitlyUrls
===================

When sending email, all URLs will be replaced with bit.ly compressed ones.
If an exception occurs, none of the URLs will be compressed.

Installation
============

After installing, be sure to setup your bit.ly API credentials inside of RAILS_ROOT/config/initializers/bitly.rb,
otherwise the tests and the plugin will not work!
